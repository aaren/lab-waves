- multiprocessing

- use new objects in generate (maybe multiprocess here?)

### Refactor

- Consider StitchedImage --> Stitcher

Use the stitcher like this:

    stitcher = Stitcher(join)
    stitched_image = stitcher.stitch(im1, im2)

Would do similar for interfacing:

    interfacer = Interfacer()
    lock_interface = interfacer.interface(im)

Or we could have `interface` as a method on a ProcessedImage.
