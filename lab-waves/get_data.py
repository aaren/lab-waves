# V2 of get_data. this is a refactoring of v1.
# want to separate out thresholding and more advanced processing.
# the thresholding is the slowest part presently and it is quite 
# stable and well behaved now --> makes sense to only do it once

# Have implemented this. intermediate files are 'basic/basic_%s' % run
# basic refers to the data that threshold extracts from the image.


# thresholding: goes through an image column by column applying a logical test
# to each pixel value in the column to determine whether the pixel represents
# green fluid or not. then, from the top down, the first pixel that passes
# this test has it's y coordinate output to a list.
# 
# so thresholding returns a list that has the length of the pixel array width.
# 
# peakdetect is a module that includes a method to make a list of the
# coordinates of maxima and minima in some signal.
#
# the measured interface and inferred peaks are then overlaid onto the target
# image for inspection.
#
# TODO 1) Wavelength measurement
# this is actually a bit involved. to calculate fwhm, need to know deviation
# from baseline and whilst this can be calculated for an initial baseline, it
# doesn't deal with the case of an undular bore, in which the baseline is
# shifted vertically.
# however, a baseline is needed anyway
#      2) baseline detection
