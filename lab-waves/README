I started this project shortly after first picking up Python. As a result it
uses a lot of pure python where it should really use external libraries (e.g.
lists instead of numpy arrays) and is generally pretty organic in its
structure.


### Development flow ###

I previously tried to use Nvies git branching model. This was a mistake.
It is far too complex for a simple project like this.

I have since reverted to a single master branch, which *should* always
be stable, with feature branches that focus on a *specific* thing and
then merge back into master.
