This branch has multiprocessing integrated into the get_data module as well as
generate. Specifically, get_data.get_basic_run_data creates a pool of workers
for performing the image thresholding, resulting in a significant speed up when
only processing a single run.

In order to get around the daemon children problem a couple of classes are
created in generate, allowing for the execution of pools within pools.
