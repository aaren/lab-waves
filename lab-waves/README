Testing
-------

The code is broken somehow. When processing basic data the process exits with
multiprocessing errors. These are present with basic_data, f_basic_data, loop
and pool, ie. all top level permutations of multiprocessing use. Inside
get_data, multiprocessing has been hard coded, i.e. there is no way to avoid it.
The processor number can be set to 1 but the code still goes through the
multiprocessing loop and when the process crashes these are the only errors
presented.

Here we rewrite get_data so that it can process without using a multiprocessing
pool, with the aim of isolating the real error.
